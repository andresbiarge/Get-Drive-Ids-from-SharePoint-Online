## Why do you care?
If you develop using healthy ALM practices (DEV / TEST / PROD) while integrating with SharePoint Online and OneDrive, you are probably going through the pain of finding the **Drive IDs** for a SharePoint library or a file.

This can be specially annoying when working with Office Scripts stored in SharePoint libraries.

Now you can use this app to retrieve any Drive Ids of any resources your user has access to.
